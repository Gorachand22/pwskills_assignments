    "A `database` is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed to provide efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. It allows users and applications to store, access, and manage large amounts of data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems with distinct characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SQL Databases:`\n",
    "- SQL databases are based on a relational model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas.\n",
    "- They use SQL as the standard query language for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "- SQL databases provide strong consistency, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, and support for complex joins and transactions.\n",
    "- They are suitable for structured and well-defined data with complex relationships.\n",
    "- Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "`NoSQL Databases:`\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that provide a flexible and scalable approach to data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "- They use various data models like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-family formats to store data.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases offer high scalability, availability, and performance for handling large volumes of data and high-traffic applications.\n",
    "- They are suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data, schema-less data, and distributed computing environments.\n",
    "- Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases lies in their data models, query languages, consistency models, and suitability for different types of data and application requirements. SQL databases are well-suited for structured data and complex relationships, while NoSQL databases excel in handling unstructured data, scalability, and high-performance scenarios."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define and manage the structure of a database, including creating, altering, and deleting database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations and examples of how the CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE statements are used in DDL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `CREATE:`\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or procedures. It specifies the name of the object, its columns or attributes, and any constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Creating a new table named \"Employees\" with columns for ID, Name, and Salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    ID INT,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `DROP:`\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views. It permanently removes the object from the database.\n",

    "Example: Dropping the table \"Employees\" from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `ALTER:`\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, or other properties of a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Adding a new column named \"Age\" to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",

    "In database management systems, a primary key and a foreign key are used to establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It ensures that each row has a unique identity and serves as a unique identifier for referencing and accessing individual records. The primary key constraint enforces the uniqueness and integrity of the primary key column(s) by disallowing duplicate or null values. By designating a primary key, you can ensure the uniqueness and integrity of your data, and it provides a basis for establishing relationships with other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, where the foreign key column(s) in one table references the primary key column(s) in another table. This relationship allows you to associate and link data between tables. The foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to existing values in the referenced primary key column(s) or are null. It helps maintain data integrity and enforces referential integrity between related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the concept of primary key and foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two tables: \"Students\" and \"Courses.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Table: Students\n",

    "|    2      | Laveena   |\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Table: Courses\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "| CourseID | CourseName                |\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "|    101   |  Data Science             |<br>\n",
    "|    102   |  Full Stack Development   |\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"StudentID\" column in the \"Students\" table can be designated as the primary key since it uniquely identifies each student. The primary key constraint ensures that each student has a unique ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish a relationship between the \"Students\" and \"Courses\" table, you can create a foreign key in the \"Courses\" table that references the primary key \"StudentID\" in the \"Students\" table. This foreign key represents the association between students and the courses they are enrolled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table: Courses\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------\n",
    "| CourseID | CourseName              | StudentID |\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------\n",
    "|    101   |  Data Science           |     1     |<br>\n",
    "|    102   |  Full Stack Development |     2     |\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"StudentID\" column in the \"Courses\" table is the foreign key that references the primary key \"StudentID\" in the \"Students\" table. This relationship allows you to link specific courses with the corresponding students.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, while a foreign key establishes a relationship between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. The primary key ensures uniqueness and integrity within a table, while the foreign key facilitates associations and maintains referential integrity between related tables."
