        "However, the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient is not readily available in most common statistical libraries. Instead, we can calculate the Phi coefficient, which is a measure of association between two categorical variables. In this case, we can treat age as a categorical variable by grouping it into categories, and then calculate the Phi coefficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a step-by-step guide on how to calculate the Phi coefficient for this data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Group the age variable into categories. For example, we can create two age groups: \"Under 30\" and \"30 and Over.\" we can choose different age cutoffs if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a contingency table (also known as a cross-tabulation) to show the frequency of each combination of age group and soft drink preference:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "                 | Coke  | Pepsi |\n",
        "---------------------------------\n",
        "Under 30         |   2   |   1   |\n",
        "---------------------------------\n",
        "30 and Over      |   1   |   1   |\n",
        "---------------------------------\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Calculate the Phi coefficient using the following formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "Phi = (ad - bc) / sqrt((a + b)(c + d)(a + c)(b + d))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- `a`: Number of observations in the \"Under 30\" age group who prefer Coke.\n",
        "- `b`: Number of observations in the \"Under 30\" age group who prefer Pepsi.\n",
        "- `c`: Number of observations in the \"30 and Over\" age group who prefer Coke.\n",
        "- `d`: Number of observations in the \"30 and Over\" age group who prefer Pepsi.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the values from the contingency table:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "a = 2\n",
        "b = 1\n",
        "c = 1\n",
        "d = 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Plug these values into the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "Phi = (2*1 - 1*1) / sqrt((2+1)(1+1)(2+1)(1+1))\n",
        "Phi = (2 - 1) / sqrt(3*2*3*2)\n",
        "Phi = 1 / sqrt(72)\n",
        "Phi ≈ 0.122\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The Phi coefficient measures the strength of association between age group and soft drink preference. In this case, a Phi coefficient of approximately 0.122 suggests a weak positive association between age group and soft drink preference. This means that there might be a slight tendency for individuals under 30 to prefer Coke, but the association is not very strong."
