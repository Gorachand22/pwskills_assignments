        "**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in statistics and machine learning. Its primary goal is to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much of the original variation (information) as possible. PCA achieves this by transforming the data into a new coordinate system, where the axes (principal components) are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and ranked by the amount of variance they explain.\n",

        "1. **Centering the Data**: PCA begins by centering the data, which means subtracting the mean of each feature from every data point. This step ensures that the data is centered around the origin.\n",

        "2. **Covariance Matrix**: PCA then computes the covariance matrix of the centered data. The covariance matrix describes the relationships between the features and quantifies how they vary together.\n",

        "3. **Eigendecomposition**: Next, PCA performs eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix to find its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. These eigenvectors are the principal components.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Selecting Principal Components**: PCA ranks the principal components in descending order of their corresponding eigenvalues. The principal components with the largest eigenvalues capture the most variance in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Reducing Dimensionality**: To reduce dimensionality, we can choose a subset of the top principal components while retaining most of the data's variance. This subset of components can be used to transform the original data into a lower-dimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "PCA has effectively reduced the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving most of the variance. The reduced data (`reduced_df`) now has only two features, \"Principal Component 1\" and \"Principal Component 2,\" which capture the most significant patterns in the original data. This reduced representation is often used in further analysis or visualization."

PCA can be used as a feature extraction technique to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining the most important information, making it easier to work with and improving the performance of machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the relationship between PCA and feature extraction, along with an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is primarily used for dimensionality reduction. It takes a dataset with a high number of features and transforms it into a new dataset with fewer features (principal components) while preserving as much of the original information as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Orthogonal Features**: The principal components produced by PCA are orthogonal to each other, meaning they are uncorrelated. This orthogonality simplifies the relationships between features and often makes the data more interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Variance Retention**: PCA ranks the principal components by the amount of variance they explain in the data. The first few components typically capture most of the variance, while the later components capture less. By selecting a subset of the top components, we can retain most of the important information in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Feature Extraction**: In the context of feature extraction, PCA can be used to transform the original features into a lower-dimensional space represented by the principal components. These transformed components can be treated as new features, which can be used in machine learning models. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data or when we suspect that some features are redundant or noisy.\n",
        "\n",
        "PCA has effectively performed feature extraction by reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its essential characteristics. These extracted features can then be used in machine learning models for tasks like classification or clustering."

        "\n",
        "Deciding on the number of principal components to retain involves a trade-off between dimensionality reduction and information preservation. Here are some common methods to make this decision:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Explained Variance**: Plot the cumulative explained variance as a function of the number of components. We can then choose the number of components that collectively explain a sufficiently high percentage of the total variance. A common threshold might be to retain enough components to explain 95% or 99% of the variance. This ensures that we retain most of the information in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Scree Plot**: Plot the explained variance for each component and look for an \"elbow\" point where the explained variance starts to level off. The number of components just before this point is often chosen as it represents a good balance between dimensionality reduction and information preservation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Domain Knowledge**: Sometimes, domain knowledge or the specific goals of our analysis can guide us in selecting the number of components. For example, if we have prior knowledge that only certain features are relevant, we might choose to retain those components.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Cross-Validation**: If we're building a predictive model, we can use cross-validation to assess the performance of our model with different numbers of retained components. Choose the number that results in the best model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use Case**: Consider the specific use case. If we are interested in visualization, we might choose a small number of components that can be easily visualized. If we need to reduce dimensionality for a machine learning task, we might choose a larger number of components that still capture most of the variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, the choice of the number of components should align with our specific objectives and the amount of information we can afford to lose. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and it often involves some experimentation and analysis."
