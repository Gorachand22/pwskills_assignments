        "\n",
        "1. Definition:\n",
        "   - Covariance: Covariance is a measure of how two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative) and the extent to which the variables tend to vary together.\n",
        "   - Correlation: Correlation is a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It scales the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables, making it easier to compare across different datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Range of Values:\n",
        "   - Covariance: The range of covariance can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of the relationship. A positive covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, while a negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship.\n",
        "   - Correlation: The correlation coefficient always ranges between -1 and +1. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Interpretation:\n",
        "   - Covariance: The magnitude of the covariance is not easily interpretable on its own, as it depends on the scale of the variables. Positive covariance only indicates that the variables tend to increase together, and negative covariance indicates they tend to change in opposite directions.\n",
        "   - Correlation: The correlation coefficient is standardized, making it easier to interpret. A correlation close to +1 or -1 indicates a strong linear relationship, while a correlation close to 0 suggests a weak or no linear relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Unit Independence:\n",
        "   - Covariance: The covariance is affected by the units of measurement of the variables. Changing the units of one or both variables will change the magnitude of the covariance.\n",
        "   - Correlation: The correlation coefficient is unitless and independent of the units of measurement. It only depends on the relationship between the variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while covariance and correlation both describe the relationship between variables, correlation provides a more standardized and interpretable measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship, making it a more commonly used measure in statistical analysis."

        "Outliers can significantly impact both measures of central tendency and dispersion in a dataset. An outlier is an observation that lies far away from the other data points, either on the high or low end of the distribution. Here's how outliers affect these measures:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `Measures of Central Tendency:`\n",
        "   - Mean: Outliers can heavily influence the mean because it takes into account the value of each data point. An extreme outlier can pull the mean towards itself, making it an unreliable representation of the \"typical\" value in the dataset.\n",
        "   - Median: The median is less affected by outliers since it is based on the middle value of the data when arranged in ascending or descending order. Outliers have no impact on the median as long as they don't change the order of the data.\n",
        "   - Mode: The mode, which represents the most frequently occurring value in the dataset, is not directly affected by outliers since it only considers the frequencies of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `Measures of Dispersion:`\n",
        "   - Range: Outliers can significantly widen the range, as they increase the spread between the maximum and minimum values. It reflects the extent of variation in the dataset, and outliers add to this variation.\n",
        "   - Variance: Outliers contribute to larger variance values, as they are squared during the calculation. The squared differences between outliers and the mean result in larger deviations.\n",
        "   - Standard Deviation: Similar to variance, outliers have a substantial impact on the standard deviation since it is based on the square root of the variance. Outliers can increase the standard deviation and lead to a less accurate representation of the spread of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Consider a dataset representing salaries (in thousands) of employees in a company:\n",
        "[30, 32, 31, 33, 35, 40, 38, 36, 34, 200]\n",
        "\n",
        "In this dataset, 200 is an outlier, as it is much larger than the other salary values. If we calculate the mean, it would be (30 + 32 + 31 + 33 + 35 + 40 + 38 + 36 + 34 + 200) / 10 = 38.9. The presence of the outlier 200 significantly increases the mean, making it an inaccurate representation of the typical salary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, the standard deviation and variance would also be affected by the presence of the outlier, resulting in larger values and indicating higher variability in the data than actually present among the majority of salaries."
