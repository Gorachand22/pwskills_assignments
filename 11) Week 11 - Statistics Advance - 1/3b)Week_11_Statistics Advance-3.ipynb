        "A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the value of an unknown population parameter. It is based on a single sample and provides a best guess of the parameter's value. For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of all adult males in a city, we can take a sample of adult males and calculate their mean height. The resulting value is the point estimate of the population mean height.\n",

It is expressed as an interval, typically in the form of \"estimate ± margin of error.\" For example, if we calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean height of adult males, it means that we are 95% confident that the true population mean height lies within that interval.\n",

        "The key difference between a point estimate and an interval estimate is that a point estimate provides a single value, while an interval estimate provides a range of values.

A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, while a larger p-value suggests weaker evidence and leads to a failure to reject the null hypothesis.
